- 🎓 4th-year B.Tech CSE. Learning **C++** fundamentals again (from 14 June 2025 plan).
- 🧪 Web3 stack: Foundry, Hardhat, Polygon zkEVM; exploring Circom/snarkjs & Halo2.

### How I work
- Bias to action. Ship small, daily.
- Readable code > clever code.
- Benchmarks > opinions.
- Security, testability, and cost awareness from day one.

### Collaboration
Looking for: performance-obsessed frontend devs, smart contract reviewers, and ZK circuit allies.  
If you bring speed or rigor, I’ll make room. Open an issue or email.
